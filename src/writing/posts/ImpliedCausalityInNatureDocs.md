I think nature documentaries are usually overscored (as in musical score). I love nature documentaries becasue they are often visually beautiful, but they often feel like cartoons because of the scoring. Specifically, overactive foley that tries to convince us not only that a gecko blinking or a shrimp walking makes a distinct sound, but that the sound happens to be single high note struck delicately on a glockenspiel.
