  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Hey, I'm Zodi, and I'm a regular guy. In fact, we're probably pretty similar. We share over 99.9% of our DNA, so if you want to know about me, you can get most of the way there simply by <strong>turning inward</strong>. Then again, we also share about half our genes with a banana, so that'll probably work too.

    I grew up in Maine on the coast and played a lot of flute. For years of my life I played through "Taffanel/Gaubert: 17 Daily Exercises" every day, which takes around 20 minutes (technically I did half every other day). What I learned is that daily habits can make you really good at things without putting very much effort in at any one time. Because of this realization, I've spent most of my teenage and adult years obsessed with habits and routine. At various points, many of the following have been essential parts of my daily practice:

      I grew up taking flute and piano lessons. Learning new wind instruments is pretty easy once you know one, and most of my jazz education was on saxophone. The past couple years I've been learning guitar, which is hard but awesome.

      Great skill to tailor your own clothes. Making things from scratch is mostly about cutting, not sewing. This mostly comes in handy now for Halloween costumes.

      Not exactly a daily habit because some percentage of days are rest days, but as far as habits go powerlifting is uniquely quantifiable. The amount of weight you squat/deadlift/press either goes up, goes down, or stays the same.
