# The World is Way Less Automated Than You Think

Everything is handmade. It would be nice to believe that when you buy a ten pack of white t shirts for $11 it is made possible by some extraordinary technology that can put together a t shirt without human intervention, but most of the time goods are cheap becuase someone somewhere is not being paid very much. There are really cool companies building machines to automate clothing production. We also need better robots for agriculture, mining, indsustrial manufacturing, construction, and defense.
