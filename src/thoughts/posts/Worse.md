# Some things are worse now

Humans have come up with some beautiful technologies that no longer exist due to some failure in the business model (too expensive) or have some negative externality (kills people).

1. Concorde Jets (business model didn't work and they killed people)
2. DDT (a spray that literally solved mosquitos, but sadly also caused cancer and killed birds)
3. Good consumer goods (now we have planned obsolescence, which I'm mostly okay with because it lets Apple keep spending on the R&D I love so much)
