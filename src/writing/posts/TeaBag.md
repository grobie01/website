# The Weeklong Teabag

A true American dream is to have a new tea bag for every cup of tea. But despite the luxury of single use tea bags, it's actually missing so much of what is great about tea. Tea is like a symphony. The first steep is some Mahler finale -- entirely overpowering as every flavor blasts you at once, leaving you entirely unable to pick up any specific thread. But there are hundreds of instruments playing, and it is only by resteeping over and over that we start to peel back the layers and this acqueous low-pass filter leaves us with a narrower and narrower band of flavor, until finally we reach our thinnest extraction, tasting only the fundamental notes of the tea. This takes about a week.
