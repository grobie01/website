# Screenplays

I have three unfinished screenplays. If you have any connections to Netflix (ideally who is not a machine learning engineer) please let me pitch them, I think these are going to be a real hit.

## 1. Oh Brother!

A classic quirky romcom about two brother that could not be more different. Everything is going right for Ben, a high-powered financier in New York getting ready to propose to his girlfriend, until his art school dropout brother Sam is forced to move in with him. The two must work out their differences and find love in the most unlikely places.

## 2. The Crusades

A medieval gay period piece set during the first crusade. The movie primarily unfolds during the Siege of Antioch, when a young Frankish general finds himself falling for a member of the Muslim relief army. The two must work out their differences and find love in the most unlikely places.

## 3. Oops, I fell in Love With a Robot!

A heartwarming, laugh-out-loud near-future romcom about a tempestuous, overwrought housewife who finds herself surprisingly attracted to her teleoperated housekeeper robot. When she arrives at the call center in Jakarta, she finds not one but two handsome men behind the controls. The three of them must work out their differences and find love in the most unlikely places.
